# Noughts-and-Crosses-with-Alpha-Beta-Pruning_202401100300276


An artificial intelligence that can play **Noughts and Crosses (Tic-tac-toe)** is to be created by applying the **Alpha-Beta Pruning** Algorithm

Each participant in this turn-based grid game inserts a "X" or a "O" into the 3 x 3 matrix. The first one to get three of their marks in a row, column, or a diagonal wins the game for themselves. The game ends in a draw when all boxes are full and there is no winner.  



Alpha-Beta Pruning is the technique the computer uses to evaluate a possible move as optimally as possible. It improves the **Minimax algorithm** by removing branches that do not affect the final decision and streamlining the whole process.  

1. Flow and Game Design

The game begins with an empty 3x3 grid. 

Each player alternates turns claiming an unmarked square with either an X or O. 

After each turn, the system checks if a player has won or if there is a draw. 

The AI uses the Alpha-Beta Pruning method to maximize its chances of succeeding when choosing the next move. 

2. Being Aware of Alpha-Beta Pruning

This strategy takes advantage of the pruning method by utilizing a motion processing tree. 

Alpha is the highest score the AI can achieve. 

The score that the human player can reduce is beta. 

The AI has options, but if a selected branch does not lead to optimum results, it will not be taken.

3. The structural components of the Logic

AI Project employ Alpha-Beta Pruning for optimal decision-making. User input: Relevant data is provided by users during their respective turns. Graphical Representation: The game board is refreshed after every move for ease of viewing.
   
4. Results

Improves the basic principles of gaming strategy and decision-making skills.
